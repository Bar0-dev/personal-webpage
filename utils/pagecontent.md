## Bio

My name is Bartosz and I am an engineer with experience in mechanical design automation and robotics. My true passion and talent is programming which I have polished for a long time before I decided to pursue a career in web development and embedded software. Being a creative mind that craves to learn new things every day helped me with exploring different technologies like React, threejs, Nextjs and using them in real projects. As an engineer, I am fascinated with combining code and the physical world by creating robots, machines and devices.
